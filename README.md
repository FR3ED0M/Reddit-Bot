# Reddit-Bots
Here are a couple of reddit bot ideas coded in python. I'm still learning to code in python, so I thought this would be a good stepping stone to start with.

They are short simple bots that go around different subreddits on Reddit, checking for specific misspelled words. The bots I post up currently run on the /r/test subreddit for testing purposes. They can be modified for other subreddits, but if you do, please follow Reddit's API guidelines. Reminder that for the bot to work, one must create an account for the bot, or it won't work when it must post a reply to a user.

There were also be a template for anyone to try out and make their own.
